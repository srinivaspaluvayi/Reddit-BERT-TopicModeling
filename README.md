# Reddit-BERT-TopicModeling
NLP project using BERT and BERTopic to analyze 8M+ Reddit comments on the Israel-Hamas conflict. Identifies and classifies ~198K controversial comments into Pro/Anti-Israel and Pro/Anti-Hamas categories using topic modeling and BERT-based real-time classification.

üìä Dataset
